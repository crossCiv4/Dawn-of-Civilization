The body of this leaderhead is a converted from Mass Effect 2 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_2) and the hair is taken from the Skyrim mod "Hair packs of Fallout3" (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17993). Therefore, while modifications of the models and artwork were made by me, I take no credit for both and all rights are with the respective owners.

This leaderhead uses the Elizabeth animations. It's completely modular. All files in the zip-file are already put into the necessary folders, unzipping it directly in the Mods folder of BtS should result into a working mod. It has a polycount of about 14800 triangles. There is only a shader version included.
