Info on the Helmets
-------------------

The Boar's Tusk Helmet was made with slivers of ivory boar tusks which were attached to a leather base, and then padded with felt in rows.
It has been estimated that forty to fifty boars would have to be killed to make just one helmet.

Agamemnon's helmet (as described in the Iliad) was made of dog leather, had two horns, with four phalerae fronting it, and horsehair on top. 1260 - 1180 BCE
